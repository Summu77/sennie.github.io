Hi! 🥰 I’m Sen Nie (聂森), currently a first-year Master’s student at the Institute of Computing Technology (ICT), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), where I’m affiliated with the [Visual Information Processing and Learning (VIPL)](http://vipl.ict.ac.cn/en/index.html) research group. I’m also a member of the State Key Laboratory of AI Safety. I’m honored to conduct my research under the supervision of Prof. [Jie Zhang](https://jiezhang010.github.io/), Prof. [Shiguang Shan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Vkzd7MIAAAAJ&hl=en), and Prof. [Xilin Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vVx2v20AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). Prior to joining CAS, I completed my undergraduate studies at the School of Cyber Science and Engineering, Wuhan University. My current research focuses on **AI safety**, investigating​ adversarial robustness, interpretability, and methods to mitigate hallucinations to build more reliable systems (MLLM, VLA, Agent). I’m eager to collaborate with like-minded researchers and peers. Looking forward to meaningful academic exchanges and potential cooperation!
